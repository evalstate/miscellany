Presentation Abstract

This talk covers
- The detailed transport choices that MCP Server developers have, and the trade-offs and options within the Streamable
HTTP Transport. Includes some experience report from building the Hugging Face MCP Server.
- Sessions: what are they now, and how are they related to transport. What challenges do MCP Client and Server authors face
- and how can they be solved ?. Will include most recent update from the MCP Transport Working Group.
- Analytics and Client Behaviour. Insights in to how MCP Clients behave at scale; sharing recent analytics from Hugging Face
to see how different Clients behave in practice in the wild (for example, session length, initialize:tool call ratios etc.).

The talk is aimed at

- Server Developers who want insights in to their options for Streamable HTTP deployment, and data on the behaviour of the
current Client landscape.
- Anyone with an interest in the variety of Clients and behaviour we see at scale on a public-facing MCP Server.
- People who are confused by the overlapping concepts of Context, Session and Transports - with mitigation strategies and
potential future direction shared.
