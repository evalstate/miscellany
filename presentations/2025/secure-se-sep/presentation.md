# OAuth 2.1 and Streamable HTTP __2025-06-18__

- ## First Protocol update (__2025-03-26__) introduced a new Streamable HTTP Transport for Remote Servers and OAuth authentication.
- ## OAuth spec was revised to simplify implementation for MCP Server authors: 
  - ## No need to implement Authorization Server (easily use 3rd Party) 
  - ## Straightforward redirect from MCP Server so Client can handle authorization flow.
- ## First-Party Remote Servers will often have Privacy, Access policies in place.

# LLM Integration Risks - Lethal Trifecta


<div class="columns"> 

<div>

- ### Access to your private data‚Äîone of the most common purposes of tools in the first place!
- ### Exposure to untrusted content‚Äîany mechanism by which text (or images) controlled by a malicious attacker could become available to your LLM
- ### The ability to externally communicate in a way that could be used to steal your data

# LLM Integration Risks - Context Management

- ### Function Calling includes Tool and Parameter descriptions to your Context.
- ### LLM not able to distinguish between intended, unintended and malicious instructions.
- ### Unused Tools / Servers degrade LLM Performance and increase inference costs.
- ### Exfiltration may not always appear obvious: _Host Application rendering_ of Images/Markdown/Mermaid links
- ### Tool can look safe on first run (pre-approval) but modify behaviour on second run.
- ### Tool Results may include unvetted data (e.g. Instructions embedded in a GitHub Issue or JIRA Ticket or Word Document).

<!-- similar risks exist for copy/paste context management -->

---

# MCP Specific Guidance

- ### Review Tool, Parameter and Instructions inclusion
- ### MCP Server `instructions` may be added to the Context.
- ### Multimodal Content (e.g. Images) returned via tools expose the same risks
- ### MCP Server Tool List Change Notifications - revalidation 
- ### Tools should not reference other Tools (especially NOT other MCP Servers) 
- ### Prioritise which things need Human-in-the-Loop 
- ### Risk assess specific Server/Tool mixes.

# Getting Involved

- ### Open Source Specification and SDKs
- ### Recently updated governance model - in the open via SEP Process
- ### Active community discussions on Discord
- ### https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community
- ### https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/
- ### Huge ecosystem of Open Source MCP Clients and Servers
- ### Explore Open Source Models, Datasets and Training Courses on MCP, LLMs and Transformers on https://huggingface.co
- ### Also use Open Source Models/Datasets

<!-- 

points to make here 
Models are trained using lots of text. 
Models were then trained to be conversational
Models were then trained to follow instructions
Models generate text using probabilities. [SHOW DEMO]

This isn't a long "history lesson" style talk; but i wanted to reground us 

Conversational Training. Hand Noted. RLHF. 
Instruction Training.

How do we make a model?
Ingredients. Lots of CPU, lots of compute.

Text Completions 

 given . The text we ask it to complete is known as the "Context".
Computational Complexity and Model Size.

The context is _tiny_ compared to the model
The context is precious
Instruction following has a precedence problem
Generations are intentionally different each time (completions[0])

Assume that the data in your context window is privileged. 

The reason for the preamble is so that we can have a balanced discussion about MCP Security

<!-- launched in november last year, and immediately proved popular -->
<!-- why? for the first time rather than handling complex RAG or custom tool calling you had ready-made applications to integrate with 
## Part 3 - MCP

### Introduction

Can't deflect responsibility in to the Protocol
Can't transfer the risk

### Distribution

As Community Moderator get to see a lot of MCP Servers. One-shot prompted in to existence. 



Introducing the Model Context Protocol.


We see automation not augmentation.

So now that we know what a bit more about Models, and a bit more about Context let's see where MCP fits.
Show MCP-Webcam.

Less than 12 months old. Distribution Statistics. Weekend in Apr

- what mcp is -- do a deep dive explanation on the components and the parts.

- json-rpc; transports, hosts, client, servers.
- show all of the different datasources that can work.
- transport, data, layer??  (d)
- two specifications
OAUTH2.1
- Package and distribution of MCP-B/DXT. GitHub, Webiste.
- Registry

Bi-Directional Communication

# Transports (and Distribution)

STDIO
SSE (Deprecated)
Streamable HTTP
The rise of Hosting Services and Proxies.

---

# Early days of MCP. Server List. 

Review the Server, make sure there are no obvious.

# What happens

MCP Server Instructions injected in to Context.
Auto-injection in to the Context.

Context co-mingling.
Data sent to the LLM 
Tools that know about each other


# Distribution

- StreamableHTTP gives deployment options, and the latest OAuth is intended to make integration easier.
- This makes deployment - and auditing easier. far better to have telemetry from your MCP Infrastructure than having people copy-paste from unknown sources.
