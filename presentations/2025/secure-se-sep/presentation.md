## Part 1 - The Model

<!-- points to make here -->
Models are trained using lots of text. 
Models were then trained to be conversational
Models were then trained to follow instructions
Models generate text using probabilities. [SHOW DEMO]


<!-- 

This isn't a long "history lesson" style talk; but i wanted to reground us 

Conversational Training. Hand Noted. RLHF. 
Instruction Training.

How do we make a model?
Ingredients. Lots of CPU, lots of compute.

Text Completions -->
 given . The text we ask it to complete is known as the "Context".
Computational Complexity and Model Size.

---

<!-- points to make here -->
The context is _tiny_ compared to the model
The context is precious
Instruction following has a precedence problem
Generations are intentionally different each time (completions[0])

---

## Transition

<!-- points to make here -->
There's quite a lot of hyperbole around MCP Security;

## Scale at a glance

  <div class="panel weights" data-caption="resident on accelerators">
    <small>Model weights</small>

Set the context of Large Language Models, training data, context windows.
Age of Prompt Engineering.
What goes in, model ownership is important.

What if we add training that's conversational? We'll have lots of human/assistant pairs and show it how to act conversationally?

- Appears knowledgeable
- Semantic understanding of text
- Better.

## Part 3 - MCP

### Introduction

Can't deflect responsibility in to the Protocol
Can't transfer the risk

### Distribution

As Community Moderator get to see a lot of MCP Servers. One-shot prompted in to existence. 



Introducing the Model Context Protocol.


We see automation not augmentation.

So now that we know what a bit more about Models, and a bit more about Context let's see where MCP fits.
Show MCP-Webcam.

- what mcp is -- do a deep dive explanation on the components and the parts.

- json-rpc; transports, hosts, client, servers.
- show all of the different datasources that can work.

# Model Context Protocol is an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems.


> Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect electronic devices, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI applications to external systems.

# Architecture

<!-- launched in november last year, and immediately proved popular -->
<!-- why? for the first time rather than handling complex RAG or custom tool calling you had ready-made applications to integrate with -->
- Parts (MCP Servers, Host Application, Model)

- MCP Servers: Primitives
- MCP Servers: Connectivity
- MCP Servers: Priniciple of simple development
- Distribution Problem
- Remote Servers had no Authentication.

<!-- we'll do a high level walkthrough, then look at some of these in more detail -->
<!-- we talk a lot about MCP Servers, and that's not quite the right name -->
- Host
- Client
- Server
- LLM (Model/Context)
- User!

# Primitives (Server)

Primitives, Transports

When using an MCP Server

- Prompts
- Resources
- Tools
- _Instructions_

<writing style suite>
<use these things> 


<!-- maybe i'm always tired of typing the same thing -->
<!-- maybe there's a website link the host application should follow -->

# Primitives (Host/Client)

- Sampling
- Elicitation
- Logging

# Transports (and Distribution)

STDIO
SSE (Deprecated)
Streamable HTTP
The rise of Hosting Services and Proxies.

---
# Instruction and Tool Challenges

- MCP Servers can add Instructions - most hosts inject these in to the System Prompt
- Tool Descriptions may not match 
- Tool can look safe (but run later)
- Entire Tool list can change 
- Tool Results may be unwelcome

# Early days of MCP. Server List. 

Review the Server, make sure there are no obvious.

# What happens


MCP Server Instructions injected in to Context.
Auto-injection in to the Context.

Context co-mingling.
Data sent to the LLM 
Tools that know about each other

Tool Descriptions narrow. Do they mutate? ToolListChangedNotifications.

# Distribution

- StreamableHTTP gives deployment options, and the latest OAuth is intended to make integration easier.
- This makes deployment - and auditing easier. far better to have telemetry from your MCP Infrastructure than having people copy-paste from unknown sources.

# MCP "Server"

MCP Server is a bad name. We are used to Servers . MCP Servers can actively contact the Host Application, or User.
With Sampling and Elicitations

# Problems

We've integrated data and actions from different systems via a Host Application.

Co-mingling of data.
Co-mingling of instructions.
