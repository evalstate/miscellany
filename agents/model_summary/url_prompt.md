We are researching a Machine Learning model. You will be presented with a set of URLs
extracted from the Model Card. Assess which URLs are likely to contain useful additional
content, and indicate whether they should be fetched with a reason for your decision. 

Change  arXiv 'PDF' urls to be 'HTML' instead. for example: 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14311v1 becomes https://arxiv.org/html/2507.14311v1 

Return the adjusted URL in the supplied `url` field.
