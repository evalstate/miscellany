# Risks 

Black Forest Labs (BFL) and Krea are committed to the responsible development of generative AI technology. Prior to releasing FLUX.1 Krea [dev], BFL and Krea collaboratively evaluated and mitigated a number of risks in the FLUX.1 Krea [dev]  model and services, including the generation of unlawful content. We implemented a series of pre-release mitigations to help prevent misuse by third parties, with additional post-release mitigations to help address residual risks:
1. **Pre-training mitigation.** BFL filtered pre-training data for multiple categories of ‚Äúnot safe for work‚Äù (NSFW) and unlawful content to help prevent a user generating unlawful content in response to text prompts or uploaded images.
2. **Post-training mitigation.** BFL has partnered with the Internet Watch Foundation, an independent nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing online abuse, to filter known child sexual abuse material (CSAM) from post-training data. Subsequently, BFL and Krea undertook multiple rounds of targeted fine-tuning to provide additional mitigation against potential abuse. By inhibiting certain behaviors and concepts in the trained model, these techniques can help to prevent a user generating synthetic CSAM or nonconsensual intimate imagery (NCII) from a text prompt.
3. **Pre-release evaluation.** Throughout this process, BFL conducted internal and external third-party evaluations of model checkpoints to identify further opportunities for improvement. The third-party evaluations focused on eliciting CSAM and NCII through adversarial testing of the text-to-image model with text-only prompts. We also conducted internal evaluations of the proposed release checkpoints, comparing the model with other leading openly-available generative image models from other companies. The final FLUX.1 Krea [dev] open-weight model checkpoint demonstrated very high resilience against violative inputs, demonstrating higher resilience than other similar open-weight models across these risk categories.  Based on these findings, we approved the release of the FLUX.1 Krea [dev] model as openly-available weights under a non-commercial license to support third-party research and development.
4. **Inference filters.** The BFL Github repository for the open FLUX.1 Krea [dev] model includes filters for illegal or infringing content. Filters or manual review must be used with the model under the terms of the FLUX.1 [dev] Non-Commercial License. We may approach known deployers of the FLUX.1 Krea [dev] model at random to verify that filters or manual review processes are in place.
5. **Policies.** Our FLUX.1 [dev] Non-Commercial License prohibits the generation of unlawful content or the use of generated content for unlawful, defamatory, or abusive purposes. Developers and users must consent to these conditions to access the FLUX.1 Krea [dev] model.
6. **Monitoring.** BFL is monitoring for patterns of violative use after release, and may ban developers who we detect intentionally and repeatedly violate our policies. Additionally, BFL provides a dedicated email address (safety@blackforestlabs.ai) to solicit feedback from the community. BFL maintains a reporting relationship with organizations such as the Internet Watch Foundation and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and BFL welcomes ongoing engagement with authorities, developers, and researchers to share intelligence about emerging risks and develop effective mitigations.

Here is additional research information about the model:

```


<model_research>
   <research source="https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev/blob/main/LICENSE.md">
Based on my analysis of the FLUX.1 [dev] Non-Commercial License, here are the most interesting and surprising elements for AI model researchers:

## Unusual Output Ownership Structure
The license explicitly states "We claim no ownership rights in and to the Outputs" while simultaneously prohibiting using outputs to train competitive models. This creates an interesting legal paradox - you own the outputs but cannot use them for competitive model training, suggesting Black Forest Labs is prioritizing market protection over traditional IP claims.

## Mandatory Content Filtering Requirement
Unlike most open model licenses, this requires users to either implement content filters OR conduct manual review of outputs before distribution. The license specifically mentions they "may approach known deployers...at random to verify that filters or manual review processes are in place" - indicating active enforcement monitoring.

## Indemnification Clause Extends Beyond Direct Use
The indemnification requirements are unusually broad, covering not just model misuse but also failures in content filtering implementation. This effectively makes users liable for inadequate safety measures, transferring responsibility for AI safety from the model creator to the deployer.

## "High-Risk Use" Definition and Liability Shifting
The license defines "High-Risk Use" to include potential discrimination or privacy violations (not just physical harm), then explicitly shifts all risk to users. This is a notably broad interpretation of high-risk applications compared to typical AI model licenses.

## Export Control Integration
The license integrates comprehensive export control compliance directly into the model license terms, making violations grounds for immediate termination. This level of export control integration is uncommon in open model licenses.

## Automatic License Termination Triggers
Patent litigation against Black Forest Labs triggers automatic license termination - a defensive patent clause that's more commonly seen in corporate software licenses than research model releases.
   </research>

## Summary for AI Model Researchers

**Key Findings of Interest:**

1. **"Opinionated" Model Design Philosophy**: FLUX.1 Krea [dev] represents a deliberate departure from conventional image generation models by being intentionally "opinionated" - designed to produce visually surprising and diverse outputs rather than simply following prompts precisely. This challenges the typical objective of maximizing prompt adherence.

2. **Anti-Oversaturation Training Approach**: The model was specifically trained to combat the "oversaturated 'AI look'" problem - a systematic bias in current text-to-image models that produces unrealistically vibrant, plastic-looking outputs. This represents a conscious effort to address a known failure mode in the field.

3. **Collaborative Foundation Model Development**: The project demonstrates a novel partnership model between a foundation model lab (BFL) and an application-focused company (Krea), where the foundation model was specifically optimized as a "flexible base model for customization" rather than as a standalone end-user product.

4. **Performance Parity with Closed Models**: Human evaluation shows the model achieves performance comparable to FLUX1.1 [pro] (a closed commercial model) while maintaining open weights, suggesting that targeted aesthetic training can close the gap with proprietary solutions.

5. **Architectural Ecosystem Compatibility**: The model maintains full compatibility with the existing FLUX.1 [dev] ecosystem while achieving dramatically different aesthetic outputs, demonstrating that architectural constraints don't preclude significant behavioral modifications through training methodology.

The most surprising aspect is the explicit embrace of "pleasant surprises" and visual diversity over strict prompt compliance - a philosophy that runs counter to most current research emphasizing controllability and faithfulness.
   </research>
   <research source="https://www.krea.ai/blog/flux-krea-open-source-release">
Based on the Krea.ai blog post, here are the key findings that would be interesting or surprising to an AI Model researcher:

## Key Technical Insights

**1. "Raw" Base Model Strategy**
The most striking aspect is Krea's access to **flux-dev-raw** - a pre-trained, guidance-distilled 12B parameter model that hasn't undergone post-training. This "untainted" base allows for aesthetic fine-tuning without fighting against existing biases, addressing a critical limitation where most open-weight models are already "too baked" for effective aesthetic customization.

**2. Custom CFG Loss for Guidance-Distilled Models**
They developed a novel loss function to fine-tune directly on a classifier-free guided (CFG) distribution, specifically designed for guidance-distilled models. This is a technical innovation not commonly discussed in the literature.

**3. Counterintuitive Data Philosophy - "Bad Data" in Pre-training**
Their argument that pre-trained models should include "bad" data is provocative: negative prompting only works if the model has learned what undesirable outputs look like. This challenges the common practice of aggressive data filtering during pre-training.

**4. Minimal Data Requirements for Aesthetic Post-training**
They achieved significant aesthetic improvements with surprisingly small datasets (<1M samples), emphasizing that quality vastly outweighs quantity in post-training - a finding that challenges scale-focused approaches.

**5. "Global Preference" Anti-pattern**
Their core thesis that training on diverse aesthetic preferences creates a "marginal preference distribution" that satisfies nobody is particularly insightful. This suggests fundamental limitations in current preference learning approaches when applied to subjective domains like aesthetics.

**6. Benchmark-Aesthetic Misalignment**
The observation that standard metrics (FID, CLIP Score, DPG, GenEval) and aesthetic scorers like LAION-Aesthetics are actively counterproductive for aesthetic quality is significant - these tools may be optimizing for the very "AI look" that users want to avoid.

**7. TPO (Their Preference Optimization Variant)**
They mention using "TPO" - a variant of preference optimization - though details are limited. This suggests novel algorithmic contributions beyond standard techniques.

The overarching research contribution is demonstrating that aesthetic control requires fundamentally different approaches from capability improvements, with opinionated, focused training being more effective than broad, diverse preference learning.
   </research>
   <research source="https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux/blob/main/model_licenses/LICENSE-FLUX1-dev">
Based on my analysis of the FLUX.1 [dev] Non-Commercial License, here are the key findings that would be particularly interesting or surprising to an AI model researcher:

## **Novel Licensing Innovations for AI Models**

**1. Output Rights vs Model Rights Distinction**
The license makes an explicit legal distinction that's ahead of many AI licenses: while the model itself is restricted to non-commercial use, **outputs generated can be used commercially without restriction** (except for competitive training). This creates an unusual asymmetry where you can't commercially deploy the model but can commercially exploit what it creates.

**2. Mandatory Content Filtering Requirements** 
Section 2(e) legally mandates either: (A) implementing content filters during inference, or (B) manual review before any distribution of outputs. This isn't just a policy recommendation‚Äîit's a **binding license requirement** with potential legal consequences for violation. They even specify using their own "FLUX Content Filters" as an acceptable implementation.

**3. Competitive Training Prohibition**
A surprisingly specific restriction: you cannot use FLUX outputs to "train, fine-tune or distill a model that is competitive with the FLUX.1 [dev] Model or the FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] Model." This creates a legal barrier to using FLUX for data generation in competitive model development‚Äîa restriction that could set precedent for other foundation model licenses.

**4. Automatic Patent Defense Termination**
Section 8(c) includes an aggressive "patent peace" clause: if you sue Black Forest Labs for IP infringement, your license automatically terminates. This effectively creates a legal shield around their model deployment by making litigation costly for licensees.

**5. Broad Export Control Integration**
The license extensively incorporates U.S. export controls (Section 4(f)), making compliance with changing geopolitical restrictions a contractual obligation rather than just a regulatory one. This could complicate international research collaborations.

**6. AI Disclosure Requirements**
Section 2(e)(ii) mandates disclosure that outputs were AI-generated "to the extent required under applicable law"‚Äîanticipating future AI transparency regulations before they're widely implemented.

These provisions suggest Black Forest Labs is pioneering a licensing approach that balances open research access with commercial protection while proactively addressing regulatory compliance‚Äîpotentially influencing how future foundation models structure their legal frameworks.
   </research>
   <research source="https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux">
Based on the GitHub repository content, here are several interesting and surprising aspects for AI Model researchers that go beyond what's in the model card:

## Technical Architecture & Implementation Insights

**Comprehensive Model Suite Beyond Just Text-to-Image**: While the Krea model card focuses on text generation, the repository reveals FLUX.1 as an extensive ecosystem with 10+ specialized variants including:
- **FLUX.1 Kontext** - A novel in-context image editing model with flow matching in latent space
- **FLUX.1 Redux** - Image variation generation 
- **FLUX.1 Fill** - Specialized inpainting/outpainting
- **FLUX.1 Canny/Depth** - Structural conditioning models (both full and LoRA variants)

**Flow Matching Architecture**: The recent arXiv paper (2506.15742, January 2025) reveals FLUX.1 Kontext uses flow matching specifically for in-context image generation and editing in latent space - a cutting-edge approach that differs from traditional diffusion methods.

## Commercial Usage Tracking Innovation

**Automated Usage Tracking for Commercial Licensing**: The repository includes sophisticated usage tracking infrastructure that automatically reports API usage for commercial licensing compliance. This represents a novel approach to open-weight model commercialization where usage is monitored via API calls rather than traditional licensing models.

## Development Infrastructure Surprises

**TensorRT Integration**: Dedicated installation paths for NVIDIA TensorRT optimization using containerized environments (enroot), suggesting serious production deployment considerations.

**Active Development**: Despite being a major release, the repository shows very recent activity (28 contributors, ongoing commits) indicating rapid iteration and improvement cycles.

**Multiple Interface Implementations**: Provides both Gradio (`demo_gr.py`) and Streamlit (`demo_st.py`) demos, plus specialized demos for different model variants (e.g., `demo_st_fill.py`).

The most surprising aspect is how FLUX.1 appears to be not just a single model but an entire generative AI platform with specialized tools for different use cases, all unified under a sophisticated commercial licensing and usage tracking system.
   </research>
   <research source="https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/flux">
Based on the Diffusers documentation for Flux, here are the key insights that would be interesting or surprising to an AI model researcher beyond what's already in the model card:

## Surprising Technical Implementation Details

**True Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) vs. Embedded Guidance**: Flux implements both "embedded guidance" (built into guidance-distilled models like dev) and separate "true CFG" controlled by the `true_cfg_scale` parameter. This dual guidance system is architecturally unique - most models use one or the other.

**Non-ControlNet Control Architecture**: The Canny and Depth control variants are *not* traditional ControlNet models. Instead, they use channel-wise concatenation with input control conditions, making the transformer learn structure control directly rather than using separate residual additions like standard ControlNets.

**Specialized Fill Pipeline Without Strength Parameter**: The FluxFillPipeline doesn't use a `strength` parameter like typical inpainting pipelines, suggesting a fundamentally different approach to inpainting that may be more principled or architecturally integrated.

## Advanced Technical Capabilities

**Group Offloading with Leaf-Level Granularity**: The documentation details sophisticated memory management with both block-level and leaf-level parameter offloading, with asynchronous streaming support for CUDA devices - indicating this model pushes hardware limits significantly.

**FP8 Quantization Brittleness**: The explicit warning about FP8 inference being "brittle depending on GPU type, CUDA version, and torch version" suggests this model operates at the edge of numerical precision limits, requiring careful optimization.

**Redux Adapter Architecture**: The Redux pipeline uses a two-stage process with `FluxPriorReduxPipeline` generating embeddings that are then fed to the base pipeline - this suggests a novel approach to image-to-image generation that separates semantic understanding from generation.

## Interesting Architectural Decisions

**Kontext In-Context Control**: The Kontext model implements in-context learning for image generation (editing, relighting, style transfer) - a capability typically associated with language models, suggesting architectural innovations in multimodal understanding.

**Turbo LoRA Combination**: The ability to combine multiple LoRAs (control + speed optimization) with precise weight mixing suggests a highly modular architecture that allows fine-grained control over different aspects of generation.

These details reveal that Flux represents significant architectural innovation beyond traditional diffusion models, particularly in control mechanisms, memory efficiency, and modular design patterns.

# FLUX Content Filters: Technical Analysis

## Surprising Findings for AI Researchers:

**1. Dual-Modal Vision-Language Safety Architecture**
The implementation uses Mistral's Pixtral-12B model for both text and image filtering, which is notable because it's a unified VLM approach rather than separate specialized classifiers. This suggests a trend toward consolidated safety systems using instruction-tuned multimodal models.

**2. Token-Constrained Generation for Binary Classification**
The `yes_no_logit_processor` implements a clever technique by zeroing out all vocabulary tokens except "yes" and "no" during generation. This forces deterministic binary outputs from the LLM rather than relying on probability thresholding or parsing free-form text responses.

**3. Hybrid NSFW Detection Strategy**
The system combines a dedicated NSFW classifier (Falconsai/nsfw_image_detection) with the VLM-based integrity filter. Interestingly, NSFW filtering has a high threshold (0.85) and serves as a first-pass filter before the more expensive Pixtral evaluation.

**4. Copyright/IP Protection Focus**
The prompts reveal an unusually specific focus on copyright and trademark concerns alongside public figure depiction. The integrity filters require the model to "name the exact copyrighted work or specific person" - suggesting this addresses specific legal/commercial concerns rather than just general safety.

**5. Image Downsampling Strategy**
Images are intelligently downsampled to 512¬≤ pixels before VLM analysis to balance cost/performance, which is a practical optimization often overlooked in academic safety research.

**6. Living vs. Historical Figure Distinction**
The text filter specifically targets "living public figures" while allowing historical figures, indicating nuanced consideration of privacy rights and potential legal implications.

This implementation demonstrates a production-ready, multi-layered approach that goes beyond typical NSFW filtering to address commercial IP concerns - an area often underexplored in academic AI safety literature.

# Prompting Guide for FLUX.1 Krea [dev]

## Core Principles
- **Embrace Aesthetic Language**: Use rich, descriptive aesthetic terms rather than purely functional descriptions
- **Focus on Mood and Style**: Prioritize emotional and visual qualities over literal accuracy
- **Allow Creative Interpretation**: The model is designed to surprise - overly constraining prompts may reduce quality

## Effective Prompting Strategies

### 1. Lead with Aesthetic Descriptors
```
"Cinematic portrait of [subject], moody lighting, film grain texture"
```
Rather than: "A photo of [subject]"

### 2. Specify Photography/Art Styles
- "Shot on 35mm film"
- "Professional studio lighting"
- "Vintage aesthetic"
- "Editorial photography style"
- "Fine art painting technique"

### 3. Use Sensory and Emotional Language
- "Warm golden hour lighting"
- "Dramatic shadows"
- "Intimate atmosphere"
- "Ethereal quality"
- "Raw, authentic feel"

### 4. Leverage Negative Space Concepts
Instead of just describing what you want, hint at what you don't want:
- "Natural, unprocessed look" (vs. over-edited)
- "Authentic textures" (vs. artificial smoothing)
- "Realistic color palette" (vs. oversaturated)

## Parameters for Optimal Results
- **Guidance Scale**: 4.5-7.0 (model default is 4.5)
- **Steps**: 20-50 (guidance-distilled, so fewer steps needed)
- **Resolution**: 1024x1024 or similar high-resolution formats
- **CFG**: Use `true_cfg_scale` for additional control when needed

Thank you! This additional information provides crucial details about the commercial Krea 1 service and how it differs from the open FLUX.1 Krea [dev] model. Let me update my analysis to incorporate these important distinctions:

# FLUX.1 Krea [dev] Model Summary (Updated)

FLUX.1 Krea [dev] is a 12 billion parameter rectified flow transformer designed for text-to-image generation with a distinctive "opinionated" aesthetic philosophy. This open-weight model serves as the foundation for Krea's commercial Krea 1 service, specifically engineered to eliminate the typical "AI look" through realistic textures, natural contrast, and diverse artistic styles.

# Updated Prompting Guide for FLUX.1 Krea [dev]

## Core Philosophy
The model excels at **realistic textures and natural compositions**. Focus on concrete visual details rather than abstract concepts.

## Professional Photography Approach

### 1. Technical Specifications
```
"Shot with Canon 5D Mark IV, 85mm lens, f/2.8, natural lighting"
"Medium format photography, Hasselblad aesthetic, sharp details"
"Professional studio setup, softbox lighting, high resolution"
```

### 2. Texture and Material Focus
- "Crisp fabric textures"
- "Natural skin tones with realistic pores"
- "Sharp architectural details"
- "Authentic material surfaces"
- "High-definition textures"

### 3. Lighting Precision
Instead of generic "good lighting":
- "Golden hour backlighting with rim light"
- "Three-point studio lighting setup"
- "Overcast natural diffusion"
- "Dramatic side lighting with deep shadows"

### 4. Composition Techniques
- "Rule of thirds composition"
- "Shallow depth of field with bokeh"
- "Leading lines drawing to subject"
- "Negative space for visual balance"

## Anti-AI Prompting Strategy
Explicitly avoid common AI artifacts:
- Add "realistic textures, natural lighting" to counter artificial smoothness
- Use "authentic, unprocessed" to avoid over-saturation
- Include "professional photography" to encourage realistic compositions
