For more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Quickstart

### llama.cpp

Check out our [llama.cpp documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_locally/llama.cpp.html) for more usage guide.

We advise you to clone [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and install it following the official guide. We follow the latest version of llama.cpp. 
In the following demonstration, we assume that you are running commands under the repository `llama.cpp`.

Cloning the repo may be inefficient, and thus you can manually download the GGUF file that you need or use `huggingface-cli` (`pip install huggingface_hub`) as shown below:
```shell
huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-GGUF Q4_K_M/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Q4_K_M-00001-of-00005.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

However, for large files, we split them into multiple segments due to the limitation of 50G for a single file to be uploaded. 
Specifically, for the split files, they share a prefix, with a suffix indicating its index. For examples, the `Q4_K_M` GGUF files are:

```
Qwen3-235B-A22B-Q4_K_M-00001-of-00005.gguf
Qwen3-235B-A22B-Q4_K_M-00002-of-00005.gguf
Qwen3-235B-A22B-Q4_K_M-00003-of-00005.gguf
Qwen3-235B-A22B-Q4_K_M-00004-of-00005.gguf
Qwen3-235B-A22B-Q4_K_M-00005-of-00005.gguf
```
They share the prefix of `Qwen3-235B-A22B-Q4_K_M`, but have their own suffix for indexing respectively, say `-00001-of-00005`. 
To use the split GGUF files, you need to merge them first with the command `llama-gguf-split` as shown below:

```bash
./llama-gguf-split --merge Qwen3-235B-A22B-Q4_K_M-00001-of-00005.gguf Qwen3-235B-A22B-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

## Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Mode

You can add `/think` and `/no_think` to user prompts or system messages to switch the model's thinking mode from turn to turn. The model will follow the most recent instruction in multi-turn conversations.

Here is an example of multi-turn conversation:

```
> Who are you /no_think

<think>

</think>

I am Qwen, a large-scale language model developed by Alibaba Cloud. [...]

> How many 'r's are in 'strawberries'? /think

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking how many times the letter 'r' appears in the word "strawberries". [...]
</think>

The word strawberries contains 3 instances of the letter r. [...]
```


## Processing Long Texts

Qwen3 natively supports context lengths of up to 32,768 tokens. For conversations where the total length (including both input and output) significantly exceeds this limit, we recommend using RoPE scaling techniques to handle long texts effectively. We have validated the model's performance on context lengths of up to 131,072 tokens using the [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071) method.

To enable YARN in ``llama.cpp``:

```shell
./llama-cli ... -c 131072 --rope-scaling yarn --rope-scale 4 --yarn-orig-ctx 32768
```

> [!NOTE]
> All the notable open-source frameworks implement static YaRN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, **potentially impacting performance on shorter texts.**
> We advise adding the `rope_scaling` configuration only when processing long contexts is required. 
> It is also recommended to modify the `factor` as needed. For example, if the typical context length for your application is 65,536 tokens, it would be better to set `factor` as 2.0. 

> [!TIP]
> The endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio supports dynamic YaRN by default and no extra configuration is needed.


## Best Practices

To achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:

1. **Sampling Parameters**:
   - For thinking mode (`enable_thinking=True`), use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, `MinP=0`, and `PresencePenalty=1.5`. **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions.
   - For non-thinking mode (`enable_thinking=False`), we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, `MinP=0`, and `PresencePenalty=1.5`.
   - **We recommend setting `presence_penalty` to 1.5 for quantized models to suppress repetitive outputs.** You can adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2. A higher value may occasionally lead to language mixing and a slight reduction in model performance. 

2. **Adequate Output Length**: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 38,912 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.

3. **Standardize Output Format**: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.
   - **Math Problems**: Include "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." in the prompt.
   - **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: "Please show your choice in the `answer` field with only the choice letter, e.g., `"answer": "C"`."

4. **No Thinking Content in History**: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2. However, for frameworks that do not directly use the Jinja2 chat template, it is up to the developers to ensure that the best practice is followed.

<model_research>
   <research source="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/">
Summary of Key Insights from the Qwen3 Blog (of Interest to AI Model Researchers):

1. Massive Pretraining Dataset and Data Pipeline Innovations:
- Qwen3 models were trained on an enormous ~36 trillion tokens, double Qwen2.5's 18T, sourced from a diverse mix of web and PDF-like documents.
- A novel aspect is leveraging Qwen2.5-VL for text extraction from PDFs and Qwen2.5 models for content curation, improving both data scale and quality.
- Math and code data were rigorously boosted through synthetic generation using specialized Qwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Coder models—enabling strong STEM and coding capabilities even in smaller models.

2. Multi-Stage (Hybrid) Training and Agentic Innovation:
- The post-training process features a unique 4-stage pipeline: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) cold start, RL with rule-based rewards, fusion of thinking/non-thinking modes, and general domain RL.
- Explicit fusion of "thinking" and "non-thinking" capabilities via model/weight-level integration allows fine-grained control over reasoning depth and latency, a novel technique for hybrid inference.
- “Thinking budget” allocation allows stable tradeoff between computational resources and inference quality, offering scalable performance (cost/quality) via prompt or code.

3. Efficiency and Performance Beyond Parameter Size:
- Qwen3-MoE base models achieve parity with prior dense base models while using only 10% of the active parameter count—this efficiency brings notable savings for both training and inference without major performance tradeoff.
- Even the small Qwen3-4B rivals the much larger Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct on key tasks, showcasing architectural and data-related improvements.

4. Multilingual and Multimodal Reach:
- Extends support to 119 languages and dialects, notably more than most contemporaries.
- Agentic capabilities are robust and include advanced support for interacting with external tools/environments (demonstrated via code and video, and with explicit MCP support), making Qwen3 attractive for RAG, tool-use, and agent scenarios.

Surprising or Distinctive Elements:
- The pipeline’s staged “hybrid” training—alternating and fusing reinforcement learning on different skill domains—offers evidence of intentional engineering for balancing depth of reasoning and fast inference within a single model.
- The use of existing LLMs (Qwen2.5-VL) to curate and clean scalable web+PDF data is a practical, scalable solution to the high-quality data bottleneck faced by large LLM efforts.
- MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) architecture enables remarkable cost/performance scaling, dramatically reducing parameter count at inference with minimal loss in capability—this is evidenced with concrete benchmarking against much larger models.

In summary, Qwen3’s development presents innovations in large-scale data curation using prior LLMs, hybrid multi-phase training for reasoning/latency balance, and highly efficient MoE architectures, all leading to a family of models that punch above their parameter class and set new standards in multilingual and agentic LLM deployment.

   <research source="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3">
Here are unique or noteworthy points from the Qwen3 GitHub repository that would be of interest to AI model researchers, beyond what is already described in the Model Card:

1. Instruct/Non-Thinking and Thinking Mode Model Branching:
   - A new updated version Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 is released, focusing solely on “non-thinking” mode (does NOT generate <think>...</think> blocks). Support for "thinking mode" and new sizes is anticipated soon.
   - The project explicitly separates its “instruct” (chat-optimized, aligning with user intent) and standard models, allowing research into alignment and mode-dependent behavior at scale.

2. Long-Context Advancements:
   - Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 claims “enhanced capabilities in 256K-token long-context understanding,” a substantial increase from the 32K/131K token context lengths seen in many contemporaries. This is a novel claim for publicly released LLMs and may indicate architectural or memory optimizations supporting extremely large context windows.

3. Broad Framework and Hardware Support:
   - Beyond the usual Hugging Face Transformers and llama.cpp, Qwen3 is demonstrated to work with diverse deployment tools — including ModelScope (for China), SGLang, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM (NVIDIA), OpenVINO (Intel), MNN (for mobile), MLX-LM (Apple Silicon), ExecuTorch, LMStudio, and Ollama. 
   - The support for "rotating context management" in llama.cpp and Ollama is called out, including recommendations on how to manage context window parameters to avoid user pitfalls.

4. Tool Use & RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):
   - The repo highlights native support for external tool integration and agent-based tasks, with recommendations for using Qwen-Agent and other frameworks. This positions Qwen3 for advanced multi-modal or internet-augmented applications.

5. Training & Fine-tuning Guidance:
   - Users are encouraged to finetune with frameworks like Axolotl, UnSloth, Swift, and Llama-Factory, supporting multiple popular SFT/Alignment strategies (SFT, DPO, GRPO).

6. Open Collaboration and Rapid Iteration:
   - The repo is highly active (289+ commits, 45+ contributors, 22.7k stars as of July 2025) and has an open approach: all weights are released under Apache 2.0, and documentation and technical reports are promptly posted with every major new capability.

7. News & Release Cadence:
   - The Qwen team is rapidly iterating, with major releases noted every few months, and explicit communication about support for both model and infrastructure level features (e.g., new context sizes, new thinking modes, improved long-tail knowledge).

8. Shell-Scripted Simplicity:
   - The repository is implemented almost entirely in shell script (100% Shell according to GitHub’s language stats), suggesting the repo is primarily a wrapper/interface/documentation for interactively running and serving existing model weights, rather than providing Python-level infrastructure or internals.

In summary, Qwen3 distinguishes itself not only by its mixture-of-experts architecture and seamless "thinking/non-thinking" mode switching, but also by pioneering extremely large context windows (up to 256K tokens public claim), extensive framework interoperability, and rapid, open updates—factors that may accelerate research and application prototyping in long-context and agent-integrated language modeling.
   </research>
   <research source="https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_locally/llama.cpp.html">
Here are the most interesting and potentially surprising insights from the llama.cpp run-locally guide for Qwen models, with a focus on points meaningful to an AI model researcher and not reiterated in the provided model card:

1. Diverse Hardware and Backend Ecosystem:
- llama.cpp is engineered as a pure C/C++ ecosystem, with minimal dependencies and a philosophy quite distinct from the Python-first "torch + transformers" stack.
- It supports a remarkable array of hardware/software backends natively, including Apple Silicon (CPU+GPU via Metal/Accelerate), NVIDIA/AMD/Intel/Moore Threads GPUs, various NPUs, and even Vulkan. This enables dense and MoE LLMs to run on unusual or edge devices.

2. Flexible and Granular Quantization:
- The framework supports numerous quantization schemes, allowing users to tailor performance and memory trade-offs down to their hardware constraints, including hybrid CPU+GPU inference for models exceeding VRAM.

3. Deep Customization and Compilation Potential:
- Local compilation is encouraged for optimal CPU (and GPU) optimization—yielding notably better performance than pre-built binaries, which may lack optimal compiler flags or GPU support.
- The guide explicitly warns that prebuilt binaries, while convenient, can lead to dramatically poor performance due to missing optimizations.

4. Open Ecosystem—Beyond CLI:
- llama.cpp is not just a program, but an embeddable C++ library. Large-scale applications like Ollama, LM Studio, and GPT4ALL leverage it as a backend, enabling broad experimentation or productization—an unusual degree of modularity compared to many other LLM runtimes.

5. Custom Chat Templates and Mode Switching:
- While Qwen models uniquely support "thinking"/"non-thinking" switching, llama.cpp exposes only the soft-switch. To force one mode, users should inject a custom chat template (Jinja2) via --chat-template-file—a developer-centric workaround not documented in most model cards.

6. Uncommon Context Management:
- llama.cpp uses a “rotating” context window by default, selectively retaining earlier tokens when surpassing context length—tunably configurable (including disabling this for strict maximum context windows).
- Supports very long contexts (e.g., 131k tokens via YaRN scaling), with fine-grained CLI flags.

7. Broad Sampling and Inference Controls:
- The CLI exposes advanced generation controls (e.g., threading, device targeting, generation sampling, and presence penalties), allowing for surprising depth in experimental setup and reproducibility for LLM research.

8. Direct REST API and Web Frontend:
- llama-server runs as a local HTTP server with both a simple UI and OpenAI-compatible APIs for easy evaluation or integration, including tool-call and reasoning parsing support with Qwen models.

In summary, llama.cpp is uniquely flexible, highly hardware-agnostic, and built for experimentation across both edge and powerful hosts. Deep system-level customization and cross-ecosystem support (via compilation, quantization, and backend selection) distinguish it as a backend for scalable, portable LLM research—qualities not typically found in higher-level, Python-focused LLM frameworks.
   </research>
   <research source="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">
Here are interesting and potentially surprising points from the llama.cpp repository, focusing on aspects relevant to model researchers and not already detailed in the Qwen3-235B-A22B-GGUF model card:

1. Extreme Hardware Versatility & Minimal Dependencies:
- llama.cpp enables large language model inference using only plain C/C++ without external dependencies, and is optimized for Apple Silicon (ARM NEON, Accelerate, Metal), as well as x86 CPUs (AVX, AVX2, AVX512, AMX), plus NVIDIA (CUDA), AMD (HIP), Intel (SYCL), Moore Threads (MUSA), Vulkan, and even experimental backends like OpenCL and CANN (Ascend NPU) — making it one of the most versatile projects for running LLMs across diverse hardware.
- CPU+GPU hybrid inference is supported: This allows models too large to fit into VRAM to use both CPU and GPU, expanding model size limits for researchers without high-end GPUs.

2. Aggressive Quantization Support (down to 1.5 bits):
- llama.cpp supports extremely aggressive quantization techniques: 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8-bit integer quantization are all natively supported, pushing memory and performance boundaries. This is not common in most LLM inference libraries.

3. Model Coverage & Extensibility:
- The framework supports not only the LLaMA family but also more than 40 other major LLM architectures (and multimodal models), including DBRX, Mistral, Yi, Falcon, Mixtral MoE, Baichuan, Qwen, Phi, RWKV, various MoE/mixture and multimodal models (like LLaVA, Qwen2-VL, Moondream, Mini CPM, and more).
- There are dedicated scripts and infrastructures for model conversion (to the GGUF format) and for fine-tuning/adapter (LoRA) support.
- Developers can add support for new architectures/models by following a clear "HOWTO-add-model" guide.

4. Advanced & Flexible Inference Features:
- llama.cpp provides grammars for constraining model output (using GBNF) — researchers can force models to emit outputs that match specific syntactic or semantic structures, useful for experimentation in program synthesis, structured dialogue, or API interaction.
- Speculative decoding is implemented at the server layer, improving throughput for applications with latency requirements.
- Features for serving embeddings, reranking, and multiple users with parallel decoding (“multi-user, parallel batch processing” from a single server) are integrated.
- Example tools include benchmark/perplexity runners, minimal demos, and advanced scripting for memory/performance profiling.

5. Ubiquitous Integration & Developer Ecosystem:
- The project boasts a broad array of language bindings: Python (llama-cpp-python, easy-llama), Go, Node.js, JavaScript/Wasm (browser support), Ruby, Rust (multiple libraries), C#/.NET, Scala, PHP, Guile Scheme, Swift, Delphi, Dart, and Flutter — further facilitating LLM research in non-standard environments.
- A large number of open-source UIs and middleware depend on llama.cpp, showing deep ecosystem integration: from VSCode and Vim plugins, to LocalAI, Jan, LMStudio, Ollama, oobabooga/text-generation-webui, and many more.

6. Multimodal and Novel Deployments:
- Recent PRs show evolving support for multimodal models (vision-language): this is not yet a given in many C++ LLM runners.
- There are projects deploying llama.cpp as WASM in the browser, and as smart contracts on the Internet Computer blockchain (llama_cpp_canister), or for game development, crowd-sourced LLM inference on Kubernetes, and more.

7. Hugging Face GGUF Ecosystem:
- Hugging Face provides cloud-based tools for converting, quantizing, editing, and hosting GGUF models out of the box, which means researchers/training shops can move rapidly from original checkpoints to quantized, locally-served models.

8. Research Collaboration and Community Impact:
- llama.cpp has over 83,000 stars, 1,190 contributors, and thousands of forks, making it a crucible for community-driven LLM innovation, rapid bug-fixes, and experimental feature additions that quickly propagate downstream.
- The backstory and manifesto emphasize “inference at the edge”—enabling advanced AI research and application on commodity and local devices, even in privacy-sensitive or offline settings.

In summary, llama.cpp offers an unprecedented spectrum of hardware support, quantization levels (down to 1.5 bits), coverage of many LLM/MoE/multimodal architectures, and strong integration for developer and research workflows — making it not just an LLM runner, but a boundary-pushing research and deployment platform for next-generation language models.
   </research>
   <research source="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071">
Here is a summary of key points from "YaRN: Efficient Context Window Extension of Large Language Models" (arXiv:2309.00071) that would interest an AI model researcher:

- YaRN introduces a method to extend the context window of transformer models (using Rotary Position Embeddings, RoPE) with significantly less data and compute compared to previous approaches. Specifically, YaRN achieves context extension with 10x fewer training tokens and 2.5x fewer training steps.
- Unlike prior work, YaRN enables transformer-based LLMs (like LLaMA) to not just handle, but to effectively extrapolate to much longer context lengths than seen during pre-training. This means models can process longer sequences with strong performance, going well beyond training data limits in terms of token length.
- A surprising finding is that, through YaRN, models can generalize to longer contexts than those presented even in the fine-tuning set—a form of context length extrapolation not typically observed.
- The paper supplies open-source checkpoints of LLaMA-based models trained with YaRN scaling, with reliable performance up to a 128k token context window, which sets a new state-of-the-art for efficient extension.
- YaRN’s code and checkpoints are available at: https://github.com/jquesnelle/yarn

These details emphasize YaRN’s efficiency, ability to extrapolate, and practical availability—factors that are both surprising and impactful for LLM scaling and long-context tasks.
   </research>
   <research source="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388">
Here are interesting or surprising points from the arXiv abstract that go beyond what is already in the Model Card:

1. One unified framework eliminates model switching:
   - Qwen3 combines both "thinking" (multi-step reasoning) and "non-thinking" (fast, contextual conversation) modes within a single architecture, eliminating the need to swap between different models (e.g., between a chat-optimized model and a reasoning-focused model). This dynamic switching can be based on user queries or templates, which marks a departure from the common trend of deploying distinct models for different AI tasks.

2. Introduction of a "thinking budget" mechanism:
   - Qwen3 enables users to adaptively allocate computational resources per inference by introducing a "thinking budget" mechanism. This balances latency and performance depending on the complexity of the task, offering fine-grained control—not commonly found in published LLMs.

3. Transfer efficiency from flagship to smaller models:
   - The team achieves high performance in smaller Qwen3 models by efficiently transferring knowledge from their largest models. This means smaller-scale versions are less costly to train but remain highly competitive—a notable step towards resource-efficient scaling.

4. Dramatically expanded multilingual coverage:
   - Qwen3 leaps from 29 to 119 supported languages and dialects in one generation, with explicit emphasis on cross-lingual understanding and generation. The substantial jump signals a major advance in inclusive language model deployment and global accessibility.

5. Public accessibility and reproducibility:
   - All Qwen3 models are released openly under Apache 2.0, facilitating community-driven research, reproducibility, and competition in both dense and mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLM architectures at very large scale.

These points highlight Qwen3’s architectural, operational, and accessibility innovations, which could be impactful for researchers focusing on multi-capability LLMs, efficient inference, and democratization of model access.

### Qwen3-235B-A22B-GGUF: Summary for Model Researchers

Qwen3-235B-A22B-GGUF is the flagship release in Alibaba Cloud’s Qwen3 series, representing a leap forward in large language model (LLM) architecture, training methodology, and deployment flexibility. Below are the key research-relevant highlights:

#### Major Architectural and Training Innovations

- **Massive and Curated Training Data**: Trained on ~36 trillion tokens—double Qwen2.5’s data—with innovative curation. The pipeline leveraged earlier LLMs (Qwen2.5-VL) for extracting and cleaning PDF/text data, yielding higher-quality training inputs ([blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/)).
    - Intensive boosting of math/coding data using synthetic generation by expert models, resulting in superior STEM/code abilities.

- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Design**: Qwen3 employs a 128-expert MoE architecture, activating only 8 experts per inference. This achieves comparable performance to similarly-sized dense models, while substantially reducing compute requirements ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388)). Even smaller Qwen3 models drastically outperform predecessors (e.g., Qwen3-4B rivals Qwen2.5-72B).

- **Hybrid Multi-Phase Training**: The model’s post-training, unique in industry, fuses "thinking" (deep reasoning, deliberate steps) and "non-thinking" (fast dialogue) modes at the weight level. This supports seamless, contextually-triggered mode switching, and exposes a “thinking budget” prompt mechanism for dynamic control of inference quality vs. latency ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388)).

- **Knowledge Transfer Downscaling**: Sophisticated knowledge transfer from the largest models to small/medium ones ensures strong outperformance relative to parameter count.

#### Context, Multilingual, and Multimodal Superpowers

- **Context Length Extension via YaRN**: Supports native 32K tokens, expanded up to 131K/256K tokens using [YaRN context scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071); reliable extrapolation to contexts larger than seen during training.

- **Dramatic Multilingual Expansion**: Moves from 29 to 119 languages/dialects in one generation, delivering high-quality, cross-lingual instruction and translation ([blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/)).

- **Agent and Tool Use Readiness**: Supports advanced agentic interaction, including external tool integration and code execution, making it suitable for tool-augmented generation and RAG applications ([GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3)).

#### Interoperability & Deployment

- **Hardware & Framework Versatility**: Native support through [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), running with optimized C/C++ backends across CPUs, GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel), NPUs, Apple Silicon, plus easy integration with vLLM, ModelScope, OpenVINO, Ollama, and more. Advanced quantization schemes (1.5–8 bits) and hybrid CPU+GPU inference are supported ([llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)).

- **Open Ecosystem**: Full Apache 2.0 licensing, open weights, and highly active community with rapid release cadence encourage reproducibility and collaborative research.

#### Noteworthy and Distinctive Research Themes

- **Hybrid Mode Reasoning/Dialogue in One Model**: No model-switching is needed for deep CoT reasoning versus swift dialogue—users can control the reasoning depth and inference cost with prompt directives like /think and /no_think.

- **Scalable Efficiency**: Through MoE and data pipeline/reuse, Qwen3 manages top-tier performance with far fewer active parameters at inference—an important research result in efficient LLM deployment.

- **Extensible, Embeddable Backends**: The C++-centric ecosystem (not just Python) encourages rapid, customized deployment—even into web, mobile, or edge/embedded environments.
