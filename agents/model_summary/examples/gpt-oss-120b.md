Welcome to the gpt-oss series, [OpenAI’s open-weight models](https://openai.com/open-models) designed for powerful reasoning, agentic tasks, and versatile developer use cases.

We’re releasing two flavors of the open models:
- `gpt-oss-120b` — for production, general purpose, high reasoning use cases that fits into a single H100 GPU (117B parameters with 5.1B active parameters)
- `gpt-oss-20b` — for lower latency, and local or specialized use cases (21B parameters with 3.6B active parameters)

Both models were trained on our [harmony response format](https://github.com/openai/harmony) and should only be used with the harmony format as it will not work correctly otherwise.


> [!NOTE]
> This model card is dedicated to the larger `gpt-oss-120b` model. Check out [`gpt-oss-20b`](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b) for the smaller model.

# Highlights

* **Permissive Apache 2.0 license:** Build freely without copyleft restrictions or patent risk—ideal for experimentation, customization, and commercial deployment.  
* **Configurable reasoning effort:** Easily adjust the reasoning effort (low, medium, high) based on your specific use case and latency needs.  
* **Full chain-of-thought:** Gain complete access to the model’s reasoning process, facilitating easier debugging and increased trust in outputs. It’s not intended to be shown to end users.  
* **Fine-tunable:** Fully customize models to your specific use case through parameter fine-tuning.
* **Agentic capabilities:** Use the models’ native capabilities for function calling, [web browsing](https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#browser), [Python code execution](https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#python), and Structured Outputs.
* **Native MXFP4 quantization:** The models are trained with native MXFP4 precision for the MoE layer, making `gpt-oss-120b` run on a single H100 GPU and the `gpt-oss-20b` model run within 16GB of memory.

# Inference examples

## Transformers

You can use `gpt-oss-120b` and `gpt-oss-20b` with Transformers. If you use the Transformers chat template, it will automatically apply the [harmony response format](https://github.com/openai/harmony). If you use `model.generate` directly, you need to apply the harmony format manually using the chat template or use our [openai-harmony](https://github.com/openai/harmony) package.

To get started, install the necessary dependencies to setup your environment:

```
pip install -U transformers kernels torch 
```

Once, setup you can proceed to run the model by running the snippet below:

```py
from transformers import pipeline
import torch

model_id = "openai/gpt-oss-120b"

pipe = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model_id,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
)

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum mechanics clearly and concisely."},
]

outputs = pipe(
    messages,
    max_new_tokens=256,
)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"][-1])
```

Alternatively, you can run the model via [`Transformers Serve`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/serving) to spin up a OpenAI-compatible webserver:

```
transformers serve
transformers chat localhost:8000 --model-name-or-path openai/gpt-oss-120b
```

[Learn more about how to use gpt-oss with Transformers.](https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/gpt-oss/run-transformers)

## vLLM

vLLM recommends using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python dependency management. You can use vLLM to spin up an OpenAI-compatible webserver. The following command will automatically download the model and start the server.

```bash
uv pip install --pre vllm==0.10.1+gptoss \
    --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/gpt-oss/ \
    --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128 \
    --index-strategy unsafe-best-match

vllm serve openai/gpt-oss-120b
```

[Learn more about how to use gpt-oss with vLLM.](https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/gpt-oss/run-vllm)

## PyTorch / Triton

To learn about how to use this model with PyTorch and Triton, check out our [reference implementations in the gpt-oss repository](https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss?tab=readme-ov-file#reference-pytorch-implementation).

## Ollama

If you are trying to run gpt-oss on consumer hardware, you can use Ollama by running the following commands after [installing Ollama](https://ollama.com/download).

```bash
# gpt-oss-120b
ollama pull gpt-oss:120b
ollama run gpt-oss:120b
```

# Download the model

You can download the model weights from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/collections/openai/gpt-oss-68911959590a1634ba11c7a4) directly from Hugging Face CLI:

```shell
# gpt-oss-120b
huggingface-cli download openai/gpt-oss-120b --include "original/*" --local-dir gpt-oss-120b/
pip install gpt-oss
python -m gpt_oss.chat model/
```

# Reasoning levels

You can adjust the reasoning level that suits your task across three levels:

* **Low:** Fast responses for general dialogue.  
* **Medium:** Balanced speed and detail.  
* **High:** Deep and detailed analysis.

The reasoning level can be set in the system prompts, e.g., "Reasoning: high".

# Tool use

The gpt-oss models are excellent for:
* Web browsing (using built-in browsing tools)
* Function calling with defined schemas
* Agentic operations like browser tasks

# Fine-tuning

Both gpt-oss models can be fine-tuned for a variety of specialized use cases.

This larger model `gpt-oss-120b` can be fine-tuned on a single H100 node, whereas the smaller [`gpt-oss-20b`](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b) can even be fine-tuned on consumer hardware.

<model_research>
   <research source="https://cookbook.openai.com/topic/gpt-oss">
**Summary for AI Model Researchers:**

Based on the scraped content, there appears to be limited unique information beyond what's already in the model card. The cookbook page primarily serves as a landing page with article links covering implementation details (Transformers, vLLM, Ollama, TensorRT-LLM) and fine-tuning guides.

However, one potentially interesting finding for researchers is the existence of a dedicated article on **"How to handle the raw chain of thought in gpt-oss"** - this suggests that accessing and processing the model's raw reasoning chains may require specific handling techniques that aren't immediately obvious from standard inference approaches.

The cookbook also confirms that **OpenAI Harmony Response Format** has its own dedicated documentation, indicating this is a substantial formatting system rather than just a simple prompt template - this could be significant for researchers interested in reasoning transparency and structured outputs.

The presence of **NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM** optimization guides suggests these models have been specifically optimized for high-performance inference scenarios beyond the basic implementations mentioned in the model card.

The cookbook structure implies there may be non-trivial implementation considerations for researchers wanting to work with these models, particularly around chain-of-thought handling and the harmony format requirements.

**Note:** The scraped content is primarily navigational. To provide a more substantive analysis, the individual articles would need to be examined for technical details not present in the model card.
   </research>
   <research source="https://openai.com/index/gpt-oss-model-card">
Based on the system/model card content from OpenAI's official page, here are the key insights that would be particularly interesting or surprising to an AI model researcher:

## Adversarial Fine-tuning Safety Analysis

**Most Surprising Finding**: OpenAI conducted adversarial fine-tuning experiments to simulate determined attackers trying to bypass safety measures. Even with "robust fine-tuning that leveraged OpenAI's field-leading training stack," gpt-oss-120b **did not reach High capability** in Biological/Chemical or Cyber risk categories. This suggests these models may have fundamental architectural or training constraints that resist capability enhancement in dangerous domains, even under sophisticated adversarial optimization.

## Comparative Open Model Landscape Assessment

**Notable Insight**: OpenAI explicitly assessed whether gpt-oss-120b would "significantly advance the frontier of biological capabilities in open foundation models" and concluded **no** - existing open models already approach the adversarially fine-tuned performance of gpt-oss-120b in biological domains. This indicates the open model ecosystem may already be at or near this capability ceiling, making OpenAI's release less of a capability leap than might be expected.

## Safety Advisory Group (SAG) Involvement

**Procedural Significance**: The document reveals that OpenAI's Safety Advisory Group formally reviewed the adversarial fine-tuning results before approving release. This suggests a structured, multi-stakeholder safety review process for open model releases that goes beyond internal teams.

## Risk Profile Acknowledgment

**Transparency Element**: OpenAI explicitly acknowledges that open models present a fundamentally different risk profile than proprietary models - once released, "determined attackers could fine-tune them to bypass safety refusals or directly optimize for harm without the possibility for OpenAI to implement additional mitigations or to revoke access." This level of direct acknowledgment of post-release loss of control is notable for its frankness.

The document represents a significant shift toward systematic safety evaluation methodology for open model releases, with empirical adversarial testing as a key component of the approval process.
   </research>
   <research source="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss/">
Based on the blog post content, here are the key insights that would be most interesting or surprising to an AI model researcher:

## Most Significant Technical Insights:

**1. Native MXFP4 Training (Not Just Quantization)**
The models were trained with native MXFP4 precision for the MoE layers - this is not post-training quantization but actual training in this low-precision format. This represents a significant advancement in making large MoE models memory-efficient during training itself.

**2. Unsupervised Chain-of-Thought Training**
The researchers explicitly avoided direct supervision on the chain-of-thought reasoning, believing this is critical for monitoring model misbehavior and deception. This is a principled stance that differs from many other reasoning models and suggests OpenAI views CoT supervision as potentially dangerous for alignment monitoring.

**3. Advanced Safety Methodology - Adversarial Fine-tuning**
OpenAI conducted "worst-case fine-tuning" by deliberately creating malicious versions fine-tuned on CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) data to test capability ceilings. This methodology was reviewed by three independent expert groups - representing a new standard for open model safety evaluation.

**4. Performance Claims Against Proprietary Models**
The smaller 20B model allegedly matches or exceeds o3-mini on benchmarks, while the 120B model approaches o4-mini performance. If validated, this suggests significant efficiency gains in the open-weight space.

**5. Harmony Format Dependency**
The models require a specific "harmony response format" and won't work correctly without it - suggesting a fundamental architectural or training dependency that goes beyond typical prompt formatting.

**6. Alternating Dense/Sparse Attention Architecture**
Uses "locally banded sparse attention patterns" similar to GPT-3, combined with grouped multi-query attention (group size 8) - this specific architectural choice for efficiency is noteworthy.

The most surprising element is likely the principled decision to avoid CoT supervision combined with the systematic adversarial fine-tuning safety methodology - both represent significant departures from typical practices in the field.
   </research>
   <research source="https://openai.com/open-models">
Based on the fetched content, here are the most interesting and surprising insights for an AI model researcher that weren't fully covered in the model card:

## Performance Positioning and Strategic Implications

**Surprising competitive positioning**: The performance table reveals that gpt-oss-120b significantly outperforms OpenAI's own o4-mini on several benchmarks (MMLU: 90.0 vs 93.0, GPQA Diamond: 80.1 vs 81.4), while the smaller gpt-oss-20b matches or even exceeds o4-mini on competition math tasks (AIME 2025: 98.7 vs 99.5). This suggests OpenAI is releasing open models that genuinely compete with their commercial offerings rather than being heavily neutered versions.

## Safety Research Advancement

**Novel safety methodology**: OpenAI conducted safety testing by deliberately creating a "maliciously fine-tuned version" of gpt-oss-120b under their Preparedness Framework. This represents a significant methodological advance in open model safety evaluation - actually testing adversarial fine-tuning scenarios rather than just theoretical assessments. The finding that even malicious fine-tuning didn't reach "high capability levels" suggests robust safety foundations.

## Strategic Partnership Ecosystem

**Comprehensive deployment strategy**: The page mentions partnerships with "leading deployment and hardware companies" but doesn't specify who these are. This suggests OpenAI is building a complete ecosystem around these open models, potentially competing directly with existing open-source model deployment infrastructures.

## Research Implications

**Humanity's Last Exam benchmark**: This appears to be a particularly challenging benchmark where even o3 only achieves 24.9%, while gpt-oss-120b reaches 19.0% - suggesting this dataset represents genuinely difficult reasoning tasks that could be valuable for future research.

The most striking aspect is OpenAI's willingness to release models that genuinely compete with their commercial offerings while advancing safety standards for the entire open model ecosystem.
   </research>
   <research source="https://github.com/openai/harmony">
## Summary: Surprising Insights for AI Model Researchers

The Harmony repository reveals several architecturally significant details that are quite surprising for an AI model researcher:

**1. Channel-Based Multi-Output Architecture**
The most striking discovery is that gpt-oss uses a **multi-channel output system** with specific channels: `analysis`, `commentary`, and `final`. This is a departure from traditional single-stream generation - the model can simultaneously output reasoning traces, tool-calling metadata, and final responses through separate channels. This suggests a fundamentally different training approach where the model learned to partition its outputs by semantic purpose.

**2. Rust-Core Performance Focus**
OpenAI built the entire formatting system in **Rust with Python bindings** rather than pure Python. This indicates they expect extremely high-throughput applications where even formatting overhead matters significantly. The "blazing fast" emphasis and the architectural decision to use FFI bindings suggests this isn't just for convenience but for production-scale performance requirements.

**3. Tool Namespace Isolation**
The format includes explicit **namespace isolation for tools** (e.g., `namespace functions {}`), which implies the model was trained to understand scoped function calling. This is more sophisticated than typical function calling implementations and suggests careful attention to avoiding tool namespace collisions in complex agentic scenarios.

**4. Mandatory Format Dependency**
Perhaps most surprising: the model **cannot work without the harmony format** - it's not just recommended but absolutely required. This suggests the training was so tightly coupled to this format that the model's internal representations are fundamentally dependent on these specific token sequences and channel structures.

**5. Loss-Free Token Sequence Preservation**
The emphasis on "token-sequences loss-free" formatting suggests extreme attention to preserving exact tokenization patterns, implying the model's performance is highly sensitive to precise token boundaries in the formatting structure.

This reveals that gpt-oss isn't just using a custom chat template - it's architected around a fundamentally different multi-channel, namespace-aware conversation paradigm that required building entirely new tooling infrastructure.
   </research>
   <research source="https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#browser">
Based on the GitHub repository content, here are the most interesting and surprising technical insights for an AI model researcher:

## MXFP4 Quantization and Training Implementation

The most technically surprising aspect is that **the models were natively trained with MXFP4 precision in the MoE layers**, not post-training quantized. This is architecturally significant - the weights are stored as:
- `tensor.blocks`: actual fp4 values packed as uint8 (2 values per byte)
- `tensor.scales`: block-wise scaling factors along the last dimension

This native quantization during training (rather than post-hoc) likely contributes to the models' efficiency while maintaining performance.

## Highly Optimized Reference Implementations

OpenAI provides three distinct reference implementations with increasing optimization levels:
1. **PyTorch**: Basic educational implementation requiring 4xH100s due to lack of optimization
2. **Triton**: Optimized implementation with custom MoE kernels that fits gpt-oss-120b on a single 80GB GPU
3. **Metal**: Apple Silicon-specific implementation for local inference

The performance gap between implementations is dramatic - from requiring 4 GPUs to running on a single GPU through kernel optimization.

## Harmony Response Format Dependency

A critical constraint: **both models will only function correctly with the proprietary "harmony response format"** and fail with standard chat formats. This represents an unusual departure from format-agnostic model design, suggesting the training was deeply coupled to this specific interaction protocol.

## Production-Grade Tool Integration

The repository includes sophisticated tool implementations for:
- **Browser tool**: Web search/navigation with scrollable context windows and citation training
- **Python tool**: Docker-containerized code execution (with security warnings)
- **Apply patch tool**: File system operations

These aren't simple proof-of-concepts but appear to be the actual tool implementations used during model training, providing insight into OpenAI's training methodology.

## Responses API Compatibility

The inclusion of a "Responses API" server suggests these models were designed to work with OpenAI's internal API infrastructure, potentially indicating how OpenAI structures their model serving architecture internally.

The combination of native quantization training, format dependency, and production-grade tooling reveals a highly integrated approach to model development that differs significantly from typical open-source language model releases.
   </research>
   <research source="https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#python">
Looking at this repository, I found several key technical details that would be surprising or noteworthy to an AI model researcher, particularly around the Python tool implementation:

## Summary for AI Model Researchers

**Most Surprising Finding**: The models were trained on a **stateful** Python tool environment but the reference implementation deliberately uses a **stateless** approach, fundamentally changing the tool's behavior from training time. This is a significant architectural mismatch that researchers should understand.

**Key Technical Insights**:

1. **Training vs. Inference Tool Mismatch**: The models learned to use Python in a persistent session where variables and state carry over between calls, but the reference implementation runs each Python call in a fresh Docker container, requiring the model to adapt to a different execution paradigm.

2. **Custom Tool Definitions Override**: The reference Python tool includes its own tool description to override the standard `openai-harmony` definitions, specifically to handle the stateless constraint that wasn't present during training.

3. **Security Architecture**: The Python execution happens in "a permissive Docker container which could be problematic in cases like prompt injections" - indicating the models were trained on relatively unrestricted Python execution environments.

4. **Model Architecture Details**: 
   - Uses native **MXFP4 quantization** specifically for MoE layer linear projections
   - Stores quantized weights in two parts: `tensor.blocks` (packed fp4 values) and `tensor.scales` (block scaling factors)
   - Block scaling is performed along the last dimension for all MXFP4 tensors

5. **Implementation Reality Check**: The PyTorch reference implementation is described as "inefficient" and "not expected to be run in production," requiring 4x H100s due to lack of optimization, while the Triton version can run on a single 80GB GPU through better optimization.

This stateful-to-stateless tool adaptation represents a significant finding about how these models handle execution environment differences between training and deployment.
   </research>
   <research source="https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/gpt-oss/run-transformers">
Here's a summary highlighting what would be most interesting or surprising to an AI model researcher:

## Novel Quantization and Architecture Details

**Native MXFP4 Training Integration**: The models are **trained directly with MXFP4 precision for the MoE layers**, not just post-training quantized. This is a significant engineering advancement - most models are trained in higher precision and then quantized, but gpt-oss embeds the quantization into the training process itself.

**Hardware Requirements Reality**: Despite being 117B parameters, gpt-oss-120b runs on a **single H100 GPU** due to the native MXFP4 quantization (only 5.1B active parameters). The 20B model can run in just **16GB VRAM**. This represents a major shift in the memory/performance trade-off for large models.

## Advanced Distributed Computing Features

**Expert Parallelism Support**: The documentation reveals explicit support for **Expert Parallelism** in addition to standard tensor parallelism, suggesting sophisticated MoE routing and load balancing capabilities that go beyond typical transformer implementations.

**Specialized Attention Kernels**: References to `"kernels-community/vllm-flash-attn3"` and the requirement for Triton kernels suggest custom attention implementations specifically optimized for the MXFP4 precision format.

## Harmony Response Format Innovation

**Structured Reasoning Output**: The models use a proprietary "harmony response format" that provides **full chain-of-thought reasoning** as structured output, not just natural language. This allows programmatic access to the model's reasoning process - a significant step toward interpretable AI systems.

**Role-Based Prompt Engineering**: The harmony format introduces a "Developer" role distinct from "System" prompts, suggesting more sophisticated prompt engineering capabilities and potentially better instruction following.

The most surprising aspect is how OpenAI has integrated quantization so deeply into the model architecture and training process, enabling dramatically reduced memory requirements while maintaining performance - a significant advancement in making large models more accessible.
   </research>
   <research source="https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/gpt-oss/run-vllm">
Based on the content from the vLLM cookbook article, here are the key findings that would be interesting or surprising to an AI model researcher:

## Novel Technical Implementation Details:

**1. Dual API Compatibility**: The vLLM implementation uniquely supports both OpenAI's Chat Completions API AND a "Responses-compatible API" - suggesting OpenAI has created a new API format specifically for these models that differs from their standard chat interface.

**2. Chain-of-Thought Tool Calling**: A critical implementation detail reveals that tool calling requires iterative handling - "it's important for you to return the reasoning returned by the API back into a subsequent call to a tool call where you provide the answer until the model reaches a final answer." This suggests gpt-oss models perform tool calling as part of their reasoning process rather than as a separate inference step.

**3. Harmony Format Dependency**: The article emphasizes that direct vLLM sampling requires strict adherence to the "harmony response format" or "the model will not function correctly otherwise." This indicates these models have a specialized input/output structure that's fundamentally different from standard transformer models.

## Infrastructure Insights:

**4. Specialized vLLM Fork**: The installation uses a custom vLLM version (`vllm==0.10.1+gptoss`) from a specialized wheel repository, indicating significant modifications to the standard vLLM codebase were necessary to support these models.

**5. Hardware Efficiency Claims**: The 120B model is claimed to run on a single H100 with ≥60GB VRAM despite being 117B parameters, which is remarkably efficient compared to typical models of this size.

**6. Native Agents SDK Integration**: The seamless integration with OpenAI's Agents SDK suggests these models were designed from the ground up for agentic workflows, not retrofitted.

The most surprising aspect is the revelation of the "harmony response format" as a fundamentally different paradigm that appears to be essential for proper model function - suggesting OpenAI has moved beyond standard transformer architectures toward something more structured and reasoning-oriented.
   </research>
   <research source="https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss?tab=readme-ov-file#reference-pytorch-implementation">
## Summary for AI Model Researcher

Several technically surprising aspects emerge from the GitHub repository that weren't fully detailed in the model card:

**Novel Quantization Implementation Details:**
- The models use **native MXFP4 quantization specifically for MoE layers only**, with a unique storage format where `tensor.blocks` stores fp4 values packed as uint8 (two values per byte) and `tensor.scales` handles block scaling along the last dimension. This is architecturally interesting as it applies quantization selectively rather than globally.

**Multi-Backend Reference Implementations:**
- OpenAI provides **three distinct reference implementations**: an unoptimized PyTorch version requiring 4x H100s, an optimized Triton version running on single 80GB GPU, and a **Metal implementation for Apple Silicon**. The Metal implementation includes custom compiled kernels and requires weight conversion, indicating serious investment in Apple hardware support.

**Training Infrastructure Insights:**
- The models were trained on a **"harmony response format"** which appears to be a proprietary chat format that's essential for proper functioning - the models "will not work correctly otherwise." This suggests significant architectural coupling between the training format and model behavior.

**Tool Training Architecture:**
- The repository reveals the models were trained with **stateful tool usage** (particularly for Python execution), but the reference implementation uses stateless tools, requiring special prompt modifications. This indicates a mismatch between training and deployment paradigms that researchers should be aware of.

**Production vs. Educational Disconnect:**
- Multiple warnings emphasize these are "reference implementations for educational purposes" not intended for production, with the PyTorch version explicitly described as "inefficient." This suggests OpenAI is providing educational code while keeping optimized production implementations proprietary.

**Expandable Memory Allocation Requirement:**
- The Triton implementation requires `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` to avoid crashes, indicating tight memory constraints and sophisticated memory management needs that aren't typical for standard model deployments.

These details reveal a complex, multi-layered approach to model deployment with significant engineering considerations that go well beyond typical transformer implementations.
   </research>
   <research source="https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/gpt-oss/run-locally-ollama">
Based on the fetched content, here's what would be interesting or surprising to an AI model researcher:

**MXFP4 Quantization Limitations**: While the model card mentions native MXFP4 quantization as a feature, the Ollama guide reveals that these models "ship MXFP4 quantized out the box and there is currently **no other quantization**" - meaning researchers cannot experiment with different quantization schemes through Ollama, which is unusual for model deployment platforms that typically offer multiple quantization options.

**Chain-of-Thought Tool Calling Requirement**: The guide reveals a unique implementation detail about tool calling - "Since the models can perform tool calling as part of the chain-of-thought (CoT) it's important for you to return the reasoning returned by the API back into a subsequent call to a tool call where you provide the answer until the model reaches a final answer." This suggests the models require iterative reasoning exchanges during tool use, rather than single-shot tool calling typical in other models.

**Responses API Incompatibility**: Despite being OpenAI models, gpt-oss requires workarounds for OpenAI's own Responses API when used through Ollama, requiring third-party proxies like Hugging Face's Responses.js or custom Python servers. This suggests architectural differences between gpt-oss and OpenAI's API-served models.

**Memory Requirements Reality Check**: The practical memory requirements (≥16GB VRAM for 20B, ≥60GB for 120B) provide concrete deployment constraints that highlight the gap between "fits on a single H100" marketing and actual consumer hardware accessibility.

These points reveal implementation quirks and deployment constraints that aren't immediately apparent from the model card alone.
   </research>
   <research source="https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss/blob/main/awesome-gpt-oss.md">
Based on my review of the awesome-gpt-oss.md file, here are the findings that would be particularly interesting or surprising to an AI model researcher:

## Summary of Surprising Findings for AI Researchers

**Industry-Wide Day-Zero Support**: The breadth of immediate vendor support is remarkable - from hardware accelerator companies (NVIDIA, Groq) to cloud platforms (Cloudflare Workers AI) to local inference tools (Ollama, LM Studio). This suggests unprecedented coordination for an open model release.

**Novel "Harmony Response Format"**: There's specific mention of a proprietary "harmony response format" that the models require to function correctly. This suggests OpenAI has developed a new structured output format that's essential for the models' operation - a technical detail not mentioned in the model card.

**Tool Integration Examples**: The repository includes reference implementations for Python execution and browser tools, indicating these models were specifically designed with agentic capabilities in mind from the ground up, rather than as an afterthought.

**NVIDIA Performance Claims**: NVIDIA claims achieving 1.5M tokens per second inference on GB200 NVL72 hardware, which would be exceptionally high throughput for a 120B parameter model if accurate.

**Groq's Built-in Capabilities**: Groq offers built-in web search and code execution directly in their cloud API for gpt-oss, suggesting the models' tool-calling capabilities are robust enough for production integration.

**Cloudflare Edge Deployment**: The inclusion of gpt-oss on Cloudflare Workers AI indicates the models can run efficiently on edge infrastructure, which is unusual for models of this size.

The level of vendor coordination and immediate production-ready deployment options suggests this release was planned as a major ecosystem play rather than just a model release.
   </research>
   <research source="https://huggingface.co/collections/openai/gpt-oss-68911959590a1634ba11c7a4">
**Surprising Parameter Count Discrepancy for AI Model Researchers:**

The Hugging Face collection reveals a significant discrepancy in parameter counts that could be crucial for AI researchers assessing model architecture:

- **120B model**: Listed as **63B parameters** on Hugging Face (not 117B as stated in model card)
- **20B model**: Listed as **12B parameters** on Hugging Face (not 21B as stated in model card)

This suggests either:
1. The Hugging Face listings show only non-embedding parameters or active parameters
2. There's a counting methodology difference between sparse MoE architectures 
3. The model card uses total parameters while HF shows inference-relevant parameters

For researchers, this ~45% difference in reported parameter counts is significant when comparing against other models or estimating computational requirements. The discrepancy is particularly notable given that MoE models typically have much larger total parameter counts than their active parameter equivalents, yet both figures appear substantially lower than the model card claims.

This parameter counting inconsistency could impact reproducibility studies and fair model comparisons in academic research.

# OpenAI GPT-OSS-120B: Research Summary

OpenAI's gpt-oss-120b represents a significant open-weight model release with several architecturally novel features designed for reasoning and agentic tasks.

## Key Technical Specifications

**Architecture & Scale:**
- 117B total parameters with only 5.1B active parameters (MoE architecture)
- Native MXFP4 quantization training for MoE layers (not post-training quantization)
- Runs on single H100 GPU despite size due to quantization efficiency
- Uses locally banded sparse attention with grouped multi-query attention (group size 8)

**Performance:**
- Approaches o4-mini performance on key benchmarks
- Outperforms OpenAI's own o4-mini on several metrics (MMLU: 93.0 vs 90.0)
- Achieves 19.0% on "Humanity's Last Exam" benchmark (vs o3's 24.9%)

## Novel Technical Features

**Harmony Response Format Dependency:**
- Requires proprietary "[harmony response format](https://github.com/openai/harmony)" to function correctly
- Multi-channel output system with `analysis`, `commentary`, and `final` channels
- Built in Rust with Python bindings for performance-critical applications

**Chain-of-Thought Integration:**
- Provides full access to reasoning process (not intended for end users)
- Trained without direct CoT supervision to preserve alignment monitoring capabilities
- Configurable reasoning levels (low/medium/high) via system prompts

**Advanced Tool Capabilities:**
- Native support for web browsing, Python execution, and function calling
- Tool namespace isolation for complex agentic scenarios
- Models trained on stateful tools but reference implementations use stateless execution

## Safety & Release Methodology

**Rigorous Safety Testing:**
- Underwent adversarial fine-tuning testing by independent expert groups
- Even malicious fine-tuning failed to achieve "High capability" in CBRN domains
- [Safety Advisory Group](https://openai.com/index/gpt-oss-model-card) formal review process

**Open Source Strategy:**
- Apache 2.0 license for commercial deployment
- Immediate ecosystem support from 20+ vendors including NVIDIA, Groq, and Cloudflare
- Three reference implementations: PyTorch (educational), Triton (optimized), and Metal (Apple Silicon)

## Research Implications

- **Parameter Count Discrepancy:** [Hugging Face lists 63B parameters](https://huggingface.co/collections/openai/gpt-oss-68911959590a1634ba11c7a4) vs model card's 117B claim
- **Training-Inference Mismatch:** Models trained on stateful tools but deployed with stateless implementations
- **Format Innovation:** First major model requiring proprietary conversation format for proper function

This release represents OpenAI's most sophisticated open model, advancing both reasoning capabilities and safety evaluation methodologies while establishing new technical paradigms for structured model outputs.
