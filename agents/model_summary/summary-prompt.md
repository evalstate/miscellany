```

{{research_report}}

```

Your task is to produce a concise 300-500 word summary of the specified model highlighting 
key points of interest for AI researchers. Make sure that major information and traits are
specified, and prefer bullet points for notable points of interest. Use markdown links to 
refer to sources if warranted.

You must also produce:

a) A "Prompting Guide" that describes the best way to prompt the model.
b) An example "Tool Description" and "Parameter Descriptions" to help an LLM Produce optimal outputs for the model
